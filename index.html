    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm a 4th year at University of Wisconsin-Madison.<br>
        I'm a double major in Industrial & Systems Engineering and Statistics <br>
        and my interests are in Machine Learning (CV, NLP),<br>
        Human-Computer Interaction and Human Factors.<br>
        Have fun exploring my page to see my past projects, current research, <br>
        and hobbies! I'll try to update this every once in a while...        
    </p>

    <p>The point of this website is to practice my HTML and (lacking) CSS skills. <br>
      Also a way to extend my resume and show a more in depth look at my past and current <br>
      experiences. If you are an employer that manages to see this... please.</p>
