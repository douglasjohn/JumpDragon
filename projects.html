    <h4>Vehicle-Driver Interaction for Automated Vehicle takeovers</h4>
    <p>This work utilizes a driving simulator, interview, and STM analysis. The premise of this study is as follows: <br>
    <br>
    We know that automated vehicles can drive extremely well by themselves, but they often don't drive in a way that makes the driver feel <br>
    safe or happy. We want the car to drive itself as much as possible because we know AV technology is safer and the  <br>
    future of our roads. So we set up many small trials, each with an obstacle or slightly annoying aspect in different weather <br>
    conditions, give the car - which drives perfectly safe - the freedom to drive, and observe the participant. The participant has a game <br>
    to play on the side, which provides a monetary incentive for playing it. Now that the driver is adequately distracted, we run the trials <br>
    and see when they stop playing the game and take over control of the vehicle. We also utilize different takeover techniques, including <br>
    different button presses and notification screens. We then perform an interview, transcribe, and run through R's STM package to determine, <br>
    as unbaisedly as possible, the common themes for each scenario/question. A lot going on but we plan to submit this work to Transportation C's <br>
    call for papers.</p>

    <h4>This Website</h4>
    <p>I think it's important to be good at a bunch of things, so this website will be an ongoing project to keep up to date on <br>
    front-end web skills, and everything that comes with it - GitHub, VS Code IDE, etc...</p>

    <h1>Past Projects</h1>

    <h4>Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision</h4>
    <p>In Abu Dhabi, I worked with my PI Chih-Jen Lin from National Taiwan University & RA Yu-Chen who is now at Carnegie Melon. My sub project <br>
    was research into long document text classification and I worked with Osama from Morocco. We had a blast utilizing <b>BERT</b>, heirarchical <br>
    <b>BERT</b>, and SVMs on new datasets we developed and preprocessed. We found that SVMs worked significantly better for this task - taking <br>
    significantly less resources in both time and computing power. Being able to utilize CPU with SVMs means this classification problem is more <br>
    inclusive, as you don't need to outsource all the work to expensive GPUs. SVMs were less variable compared to its deep learning counterparts, <br>
    providing great baseline performances to build & test new models on. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity and I had a blast, I hope to <br>
    return to the middle east soon!</p>

    <h4>BlackJack</h4>

    <p>Still my all-time favoite project. In highschool, I made a virtual BlackJack game with a betting system where the user <br>
    plays against the dealer. This game, made entirely in Java, was my first introduction to the possibilities of Computer Science. <br>
    I had just taken the AP Computer Science exam and thought that those ridiculous questions were what Computer Scientists did <br>
    day-to-day, but after making this game I knew it was something I wanted to pursue in some way. It actually was quite realistic, <br>
    the dealer would pull another card if it had less than the user (only if the user was at 21 or under of course), and the betting <br>
    system was quite realistic as well. Never got to implement splitting or anything like that, but I would always end up losing all <br>
    my "credits" anyways so I knew it worked and was realistic. Unfortunately, this project has been lost to the dark depths of the <br>
    dumpster when my highschool decided to spend $3.2 quadrillion to redo the whole school, including changing computers and data centers. </p>

    <h4>Eagle Scout Project</h4>
    <img src="https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/images/LNT-logo-COLOR-tm.jpg" alt="LNT" width="400" height="218">
    <p>This project brought my community a new campsite that taught people how to low-impact camp. Working with the Ice Age Trail Association <br>
    this was built as an official campsite that still serves visitors today. This camp adopts the principals of <a href="https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/">Leave No Trace</a>, ideals <br>
    Scouts hold dear. This campsite has tent pads outside of the "Bear-muda triangle" - a term deemed to the area between the cooking <br>
    area, sump, and bear bag areas. The campsite also has a sign with infografics and explanations of the camp, as well as a traffic log. <br></p>

    <p>This project taught me valuable project management skills such as planning and executing multiple work days, working with local <br>
    companies to source materials (sign, sump), communicating between administrative bodies (Wisconsin DNR, Ice Age Trail Association), <br>
    and delivering on time. I also learned valuable handy man skills, all those posts, frames, and sumps don't build themselves.</p>
