    <h1>Current Projects</h1>
    <h2>Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision</h2>
    <p>Using <b>BELT</b> as an alternative for long document multi-label text classification istead of BERT. I'm in Abu Dhabi for this project <br>
    and I'm having a blast. I'm currently running linear & <b>BERT</b> out-of-the-box, tuned, heirarchical, and other models to provide <br>
    baselines when we start testing <b>BELT</b> and maybe even LongFormer or BigBird. At the end of this project, I hope to give an update <br>
    and maybe even a research paper on our findings.</p>

    <h2>This Website</h2>
    <p>I think it's important to be good at a bunch of things, so this website will be an ongoing project to keep up to date on <br>
    front-end web skills, and everything that comes with it - GitHub, VS Code, etc...</p>

    <h1>Past Projects</h1>
    <h2>BlackJack</h2>
    <img src="https://images.headstuff.org/2018/02/19173432/21-750x430.jpg" alt="Basically my computer program">
    <p>Still my all-time favoite project. In highschool, I made a virtual BlackJack game with a betting system where the user <br>
    plays against the dealer. This game, made entirely in Java, was my first introduction to the possibilities of Computer Science. <br>
    I had just taken the AP Computer Science exam and thought that those ridiculous questions were what Computer Scientists did <br>
    day-to-day, but after making this game I knew it was something I wanted to pursue in some way. It actually was quite realistic, <br>
    the dealer would pull another card if it had less than the user (only if the user was at 21 or under of course), and the betting <br>
    system was quite realistic as well. Never got to implement splitting or anything like that, but I would always end up losing all <br>
    my "credits" anyways so I knew it worked and was realistic. Unfortunately, this project has been lost to the dark depths of the <br>
    dumpster when my highschool decided to spend $3.2 quadrillion to redo the whole school, including changing computers and data centers. </p>

    <h2>Eagle Scout Project</h2>
    <img src="https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/images/LNT-logo-COLOR-tm.jpg" alt="LNT" width="400" height="218">
    <p>This project brought my community a new campsite that taught people how to low-impact camp. Working with the Ice Age Trail Association <br>
    this was built as an official campsite that still serves visitors today. This camp adopts the principals of <a href="https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/">Leave No Trace</a>, ideals <br>
    Scouts hold dear. This campsite has tent pads outside of the "Bear-muda triangle" - a term deemed to the area between the cooking <br>
    area, sump, and bear bag areas. The campsite also has a sign with infografics and explanations of the camp, as well as a traffic log. <br></p>

    <p>This project taught me valuable project management skills such as planning and executing multiple work days, working with local <br>
    companies to source materials (sign, sump), communicating between administrative bodies (Wisconsin DNR, Ice Age Trail Association), <br>
    and delivering on time. I also learned valuable handy man skills, all those posts, frames, and sumps don't build themselves.</p>
