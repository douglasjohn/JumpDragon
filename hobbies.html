    <h4>Travel</h4>
    <p>Fortunate to have visited 22 countries. I always have a grand time in Kuala Lumpur and I hope to visit the Merdeka 118 soon. <br>
    Taipei, home to the greatest museums in the world (even better than the Smithsonian), is remarkable and the 101 is phenomenal <br>
    building. Singapore, home to some of the greatest food in the world is the most modern place I've been to, and quite possibly <br>
    in the world. I still need to test this by visiting mainland China, specifically Shanghai/Hangzhou. Most of my current interests <br>
    in travel can be found in mainland China. Cities like Qingdao and Chongqing have an odd allure that I'd love to experience. <br>
    I'm also interested in visiting Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, especially after spending time in Abu Dhabi. Also, Namibia would be cool.</p>
    <p>If I could recommend a travel place for someone, it would be Hong Kong by a mile. I solo traveled and spent 10 days there <br>
    and had a blast. The city is amazing and the universities were fun to explore. I'm currently looking at opportunities at <br>
    The University of Hong Kong, I had a blast exploring the campus and I love the neighboring streets. Maybe post undergrad?</p>
    <h4>Cooking</h4>
    <p>I love cooking and will make basically anything. Spent a lot of time growing up working in a winehouse and learning <br>
    cooking techniques and kitchen skills, but I don't make too much Italian food these days, the main theme. Still drink wine though...</p>
