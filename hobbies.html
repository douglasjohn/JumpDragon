    <h1>Travel</h1>
    <p>Fortunate to have visited 22 countries. I always have a grand time in Kuala Lumpur and I hope to visit the now second tallest building in the world, <br>
    the Merdeka 118, soon. Taipei, home to the greatest museums in the world (even better than the Smithsonian), is a remarkable city and the 101 is a  <br>
    menacingly gorgeous building. Singapore, home to some of the greatest food in the world is certainly the most modern place I've been to, and quite possibly <br>
    the most modern place in the world. I still need to test this by visiting mainland China, specifically Shanghai/Hangzhou. Actually, most of my current interests <br>
    in travel can be found in mainland China. Cities like Qingdao with its magnificent shore lightshow and Chongqing's mountain city have an odd allure that <br>
    I'd love to experience. My recent summer in Abu Dhabi sparked my interest in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, as many friends I made live there. Also, Namibia would be cool.</p>
    <p>If I could recommend a travel place for someone, it would be Hong Kong by a mile. I solo traveled, spending 10 days there and had a blast. <br>
    The city is amazing and a blast to explore. The street food is great, the museums are phenomenal, the transit is diverse - along with the people of Hong Kong. <br>
    Although "dreamlands" like Japan exist, a major reason why I couldn't see myself living there is because the population is so homogenous. Thsi is <br>
    not the case in Hong Kong. I saw people of all colors and background while roaming the streets, and even played soccer with these kids from Nepal, <br>
    India, and Jordan. I truely connected with this city and I'm currently looking at opportunities at The University of Hong Kong. I had a blast exploring <br>
    the campus and I love the neighboring streets. Maybe post undergrad?</p>
    <h1>Cooking</h1>
    <p>I love cooking and will make basically anything. Spent a lot of time growing up working in an Italian winehouse and learning <br>
    cooking techniques and kitchen skills, but I don't make too much Italian food these days. Still drink wine though...</p>
